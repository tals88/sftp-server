# Changes Made to SFTP Server

## Summary

Successfully transformed the SFTP server from a simple single-user implementation with complex file type identification logic into a secure, production-ready multi-user SFTP server suitable for AWS deployment.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Removed Complex File Type Logic ✅

**Before:**
- Complex file extension detection and preservation
- Original filename tracking with maps
- Complicated directory write handling with automatic filename generation
- File extension extraction using regex patterns
- Default extension assignment (.bin fallback)

**After:**
- Simplified file handling without type detection
- Direct file operations using provided filenames
- Clean, straightforward SFTP protocol implementation
- Removed unnecessary complexity and potential security vulnerabilities

### 2. Added Multi-User Support ✅

**New Features:**
- User database with encrypted password storage (bcrypt)
- Per-user isolated storage directories
- Granular permission system (read, write, delete, createDir)
- User quota management
- Admin CLI for user management

### 3. Enhanced Security ✅

**Security Improvements:**
- Path traversal protection
- User isolation (users can only access their own directories)
- Failed login attempt tracking and account lockout
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Environment-based configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting protection

### 4. Production-Ready Features ✅

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker containerization
- AWS CloudFormation template for ECS deployment
- EFS integration for persistent storage
- Health checks and monitoring
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Structured logging with metadata

**Configuration:**
- Environment variable configuration
- Configurable quotas and limits
- Flexible permission system
- Production/development environment support

## Security Enhancements

1. **Authentication**
   - Bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
   - Failed attempt tracking
   - Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
   - 15-minute lockout duration

2. **Authorization**
   - Per-user directory isolation
   - Granular permissions (read/write/delete/createDir)
   - Path traversal protection
   - Quota enforcement

3. **Data Protection**
   - User data isolation
   - Secure file operations
   - Input validation
   - Error message sanitization

## Deployment Options

1. **Local Development**
   - Direct Node.js execution
   - Environment file configuration
   - Local storage

2. **Docker Deployment**
   - Containerized application
   - Volume mounting for persistence
   - Health checks

3. **AWS ECS Deployment**
   - Fargate serverless containers
   - EFS for persistent storage
   - Load balancer integration
   - CloudWatch monitoring

## Admin Interface

New CLI commands for user management:
- `create-user` - Create new users with permissions
- `list-users` - View all users and their status
- `show-user` - Detailed user information
- `delete-user` - Remove users and their data
- `update-password` - Change user passwords
- `set-active` - Enable/disable users
- `update-permissions` - Modify user permissions
- `status` - Server configuration overview

## Testing Results

✅ Server starts successfully on port 2223
✅ User creation works correctly
✅ Admin CLI functions properly
✅ Configuration system operational
✅ Dependencies installed without issues
✅ SSH key generation successful

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Security Hardening**
   - Change default admin password
   - Configure appropriate network access
   - Set up SSL/TLS if using load balancer
   - Enable audit logging

2. **Monitoring Setup**
   - CloudWatch metrics and alarms
   - Log aggregation and analysis
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security event tracking

3. **Backup Strategy**
   - EFS backup configuration
   - User data backup procedures
   - Disaster recovery planning

4. **Scaling Considerations**
   - Multiple container instances
   - Load balancer configuration
   - Database migration for user data
   - Shared storage optimization

The SFTP server is now ready for secure, multi-user production deployment on AWS with proper user management, security controls, and operational features.
